Widget Uses and Experience Purpose
The User will utilize the dashboard to answer their questions related to: 
1.	The Census Tracts containing the largest counts of crimes in 2019 and 2020
2.	The Census Tracts with the largest to smallest differences in crimes between the two years
3.	The trendlines between average income and theft rates
4.	Averaging these variables by the spatial filter of the map extent as the user pans through the neighbourhood census tracts

Dashboard Indicators: 

Top Left â€“ Allows the user to see the Progression of theft counts with the ascending values of average income by census tracts within the map extent.
The purpose of this dashboard indicator is to help users understand whether there is a relationship between income and theft in the areas displayed on the map.  If the graph shows a clear trend of increased theft counts as average income decreases,this could suggest that poverty and crime are correlated in the area.
